# Hey there! I'm Fairy 👋  
🎮 I build small worlds you can play in.  

I’m an **IT student at IGDTUW** who loves blending **art, storytelling, and code** — whether it’s cozy 2D games, interactive apps, or AI-driven characters.  
Right now, I’m learning how to turn imagination into playable realities ✨
